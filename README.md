# ChickenCoopDoor
By Asami De Almeida (formerly known as Rowan Rathod)

This is the code for the light controlled automatic chicken coop door.

This project was made for my year 12 high school robotics project. The door opens when there is increased light (such as at sunrise) and closes when there is decreased light (such as at sunset). There is an option to manually open and close the door via a push button if required.
